What is DrawBin?
----------------

DrawBin is a web application that allows the creation of images in your browser
by making simple drawings and uploading them to various web services. The
concept is that some times you have an idea that can only be expressed in a
diagram. This application allows you to easily map out your idea and quickly
share it with others.

The name is a spinoff of a pastebin service. The sense here is instead of
pasting content into a website, you draw it out yourself.
